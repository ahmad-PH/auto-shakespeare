# SuperMario - UTAP Spring98

This is a minimal, c++ implementation of the famous and nostalgic game [SuperMario](https://supermariobros.io/), which was chosen as a course project for the Advanced Programming course of the Computer Engineering major of [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), on the 2019 spring semester. 
As a teaching assistant for this course who was in charge of designing this assignment, I had the duty of writing the code that was expected of the students, in order to make sure that the project was neither too big, nor too small. Moreover, it would help bring out all those small ambiguities earlier, that would otherwise be discovered only after the students had started working on the project, and thus help save both the TAs and students significant amounts of time. The repository would also be shown to the students as an example of a "good-enough" design to help guide them towards better designs.

This project is built using the [RSDL](https://github.com/UTAP/RSDL) (Ramtin's Simple DirectMedia Layer) library, which is a library developed to help students use the [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) library through a simpler and more object-oriented interface. 

Here's a short video that shows how my implementation actually looks like:

## Getting Started

To play this game, you need to do the typical steps for running any c-based project.
First, either clone the repository or simply download its ZIP and then extract it. Then, enter the extracted directory, and run the following to create the executable (named maio.out):
```
make
```
Then, you can play the game using the command below:
```
./mario.out
```
The game currently has only one level, and it will default to that one level if you run the executable as shown above. If you create a new level and you want to play it, then you must run
```
./mario.out <level-file-address>
```

## Dependencies
* SDL2
  * SDL2 Image Loading Library
  * SDL2 Mixer Library
  * SDL2 TrueType Font Library
  
you can refer to [this](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php) page for installation instructions. if you are using linux and have the `apt` package manager available, you can run the following command to install the dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev 
```
